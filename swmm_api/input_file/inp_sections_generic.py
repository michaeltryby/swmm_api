        assumed to be 0.

        TEMPERATURE indicates that evaporation rates will be computed from the daily air
        temperatures contained in an external climate file whose name is provided in the
        [TEMPERATURE] section (see below). This method also uses the siteâ€™s latitude, which
        can also be specified in the [TEMPERATURE] section.

        FILE indicates that evaporation data will be read directly from the same external
        climate file used for air temperatures as specified in the [TEMPERATURE] section
        (see below).

        RECOVERY identifies an optional monthly time pattern of multipliers used to modify
        infiltration recovery rates during dry periods. For example, if the normal infiltration
        recovery rate was 1% during a specific time period and a pattern factor of 0.8 applied
        to this period, then the actual recovery rate would be 0.8%.

        DRY_ONLY determines if evaporation only occurs during periods with no precipitation.

            the y (dependent variable) value corresponding to x

        Multiple pairs of x-y values can appear on a line. If more than one line is needed,
        repeat the curve's name (but not the type) on subsequent lines. The x-values must
        be entered in increasing order.

        Choices for curve type have the following meanings (flows are expressed in the
        userâ€™s choice of flow units set in the [OPTIONS] section):

        STORAGE
            surface area in ft2 (m2) v. depth in ft (m) for a storage unit node
        SHAPE
            width v. depth for a custom closed cross-section, both normalized with respect to full depth
        DIVERSION
            diverted outflow v. total inflow for a flow divider node
        TIDAL
            water surface elevation in ft (m) v. hour of the day for an outfall node
        PUMP1
            pump outflow v. increment of inlet node volume in ft3 (m3)
        PUMP2
            pump outflow v. increment of inlet node depth in ft (m)
        PUMP3
            pump outflow v. head difference between outlet and inlet nodes in ft (m)
        PUMP4
            pump outflow v. continuous depth in ft (m)
        RATING
            outlet flow v. head in ft (m)
        CONTROL
            control setting v. controller variable

    Examples:
        ;Storage curve (x = depth, y = surface area)
        AC1 STORAGE 0 1000 2 2000 4 3500 6 4200

    Remarks:

            name of a pollutant.
        InitBuildup
            initial buildup of pollutant (lbs/acre or kg/hectare).

        More than one pair of pollutant - buildup values can be entered per line. If more than
        one line is needed, then the subcatchment name must still be entered first on the

        by applying the DRY_DAYS option (specified in the [OPTIONS] section) to the
        pollutantâ€™s buildup function for each land use in the subcatchment.
