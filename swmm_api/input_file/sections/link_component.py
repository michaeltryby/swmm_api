    Formats:
        ::

    Format-PCSWMM:
        ``Link Shape Geom1 Geom2 Geom3 Geom4 (Barrels Culvert)``

    Remarks:
        The Culvert code number is used only for conduits that act as culverts
        and should be analyzed for inlet control conditions using the FHWA HDS-5 method.

        The ``CUSTOM`` shape is a closed conduit whose width versus height is described by a user-supplied Shape Curve.

        An ``IRREGULAR`` cross-section is used to model an open channel whose geometry is described by a Transect object.

    Attributes:
        Link (str): name of the conduit, orifice, or weir.
        Shape (str): cross-section shape (see Tables D-1 below or 3-1 for available shapes).
        Geom1 (float): full height of the cross-section (ft or m).
        Geom2-4: auxiliary parameters (width, side slopes, etc.) as listed in Table D-1.
        Barrels (int): number of barrels (i.e., number of parallel pipes of equal size, slope, and roughness) associated with a conduit (default is 1).
        Culvert (int): code number from Table A.10 for the conduitâ€™s inlet geometry if it is a culvert subject to possible inlet flow control (leave blank otherwise).
        Curve (str): name of a Shape Curve in the [``CURVES``] section that defines how width varies with depth.
        Tsect (str): name of an entry in the [``TRANSECTS``] section that describes the crosssection geometry of an irregular channel.

    Remarks:
        Minor losses are only computed for the Dynamic Wave flow routing option (see
        [OPTIONS] section). They are computed as Kv 2 /2g where K = minor loss coefficient, v
        = velocity, and g = acceleration of gravity. Entrance losses are based on the velocity
        at the entrance of the conduit, exit losses on the exit velocity, and average losses on
        the average velocity.

        losses.
