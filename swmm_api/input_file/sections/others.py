    Remarks:
        The MONTHLY format is used to set monthly pattern factors for dry weather flow constituents.

        The DAILY format is used to set dry weather pattern factors for each day of the week, where Sunday is day 1.

        The HOURLY format is used to set dry weather factors for each hour of the day starting from midnight.
        If these factors are different for weekend days than for weekday days then the WEEKEND format can be used
        to specify hourly adjustment factors just for weekends.

        More than one line can be used to enter a pattern’s factors by repeating the pattern’s name
        (but not the pattern type) at the beginning of each additional line.

        The pattern factors are applied as multipliers to any baseline dry weather flows or quality

    Purpose:
        Describes the cross-section geometry of natural channels or conduits with irregular shapes

            X1 Name Nsta Xleft Xright 0 0 0 Lfactor Wfactor Eoffset
            GR Elev Station ... Elev Station

    Remarks:
        Transect geometry is described as shown below, assuming that one is looking in a downstream direction:

        The first line in this section must always be a NC line. After that, the NC line is only needed when a
        transect has
        different Manning’s n values than the previous one.

        The Manning’s n values on the NC line will supersede any roughness value entered for the conduit which uses the
        irregular cross-section.

        There should be one X1 line for each transect.
        Any number of GR lines may follow, and each GR line can have any number of Elevation-Station data pairs.
        (In HEC-2 the GR line is limited to 5 stations.)

        The station that defines the left overbank boundary on the X1 line must correspond to one of the station entries
        on the GR lines that follow. The same holds true for the right overbank boundary. If there is no match,
        a warning
        will be issued and the program will assume that no overbank area exists.

        The meander modifier is applied to all conduits that use this particular transect for their cross section.
        It assumes that the length supplied for these conduits is that of the longer main channel.
        SWMM will use the shorter overbank length in its calculations while increasing the main channel roughness to
        account
        for its longer length.

    Purpose:
        Determines how pumps and regulators will be adjusted based on simulation time or
        conditions at specific nodes and links.

    Formats:
        Each control rule is a series of statements of the form:
        ::

            RULE ruleID
            IF condition_1
            AND condition_2

            Etc.
            PRIORITY value

    Remarks:
        RuleID an ID label assigned to the rule.
        condition_n a condition clause.
        action_n an action clause.
        value a priority value (e.g., a number from 1 to 5).

        A condition clause of a Control Rule has the following format:
            Object Name Attribute Relation Value

        where Object is a category of object, Name is the object’s assigned ID name,
        Attribute is the name of an attribute or property of the object, Relation is a
        relational operator (=, <>, <, <=, >, >=), and Value is an attribute value.

            Name ( Date ) Hour Value ...
            Name Time Value ...
            Name FILE Fname

    Remarks:
        There are two options for supplying the data for a time series:
        i.: directly within this input file section as described by the first two formats
        ii.: through an external data file named with the third format.

        When direct data entry is used, multiple date-time-value or time-value entries can
        appear on a line. If more than one line is needed, the table's name must be repeated
        as the first entry on subsequent lines.

        When an external file is used, each line in the file must use the same formats listed
        above, except that only one date-time-value (or time-value) entry is allowed per line.
        Any line that begins with a semicolon is considered a comment line and is ignored.
        Blank lines are not allowed.

        Note that there are two methods for describing the occurrence time of time series data:

        - as calendar date/time of day (which requires that at least one date, at the start of the series, be entered)
        - as elapsed hours since the start of the simulation.

        For the first method, dates need only be entered at points in time when a new day occurs.

    Section: [**HYDROGRAPHS**]

    Purpose:
        Specifies the shapes of the triangular unit hydrographs that determine the amount of
        rainfall-dependent infiltration/inflow (RDII) entering the drainage system.

    Formats:
        ::

            Name Raingage
            Name Month SHORT/MEDIUM/LONG R T K (Dmax Drec D0)

    Remarks:
        Name
            name assigned to a unit hydrograph group.
        Raingage
            name of the rain gage used by the unit hydrograph group.
        Month
            month of the year (e.g., JAN, FEB, etc. or ALL for all months).
        R
            response ratio for the unit hydrograph.
        T
            time to peak (hours) for the unit hydrograph.
        K
            recession limb ratio for the unit hydrograph.
        Dmax
            maximum initial abstraction depth available (in rain depth units).
        Drec
            initial abstraction recovery rate (in rain depth units per day)
        D0
            initial abstraction depth already filled at the start of the simulation (in rain depth units).

        For each group of unit hydrographs, use one line to specify its rain gage followed by
        as many lines as are needed to define each unit hydrograph used by the group
        throughout the year. Three separate unit hydrographs, that represent the short-term,
        medium-term, and long-term RDII responses, can be defined for each month (or all
        months taken together). Months not listed are assumed to have no RDII.

        The response ratio (R) is the fraction of a unit of rainfall depth that becomes RDII.
        The sum of the ratios for a set of three hydrographs does not have to equal 1.0.

        The recession limb ratio (K) is the ratio of the duration of the hydrograph’s recession
        limb to the time to peak (T) making the hydrograph time base equal to T*(1+K) hours.
        The area under each unit hydrograph is 1 inch (or mm).

        The optional initial abstraction parameters determine how much rainfall is lost at the
        start of a storm to interception and depression storage. If not supplied then the
        default is no initial abstraction.

        Each washoff function expresses its results in different units.

        For the Exponential function the runoff variable is expressed in catchment depth
        per unit of time (inches per hour or millimeters per hour), while for the Rating Curve
        function it is in whatever flow units were specified in the [``OPTIONS``] section of the
        input file (e.g., ``CFS``, ``CMS``, etc.).

        The buildup parameter in the Exponential function is the current total buildup over
        the subcatchment’s land use area in mass units. The units of C1 in the Exponential
        function are (in/hr)
        -C2 per hour (or (mm/hr) -C2 per hour). For the Rating Curve
        function, the units of ``C1`` depend on the flow units employed. For the EMC (event

        Supplies parameters for each unconfined groundwater aquifer in the study area.
        Aquifers consist of two zones – a lower saturated zone and an upper unsaturated
        zone with a moving boundary between the two.

            Name Por WP FC Ks Kslp Tslp ETu ETs Seep Ebot Egw Umc (Epat)

    Args:
        Name (str):
            name assigned to aquifer.
        Por (float):
            soil porosity (volumetric fraction).
        WP (float):
            soil wilting point (volumetric fraction).
        FC (float):
            soil field capacity (volumetric fraction).
        Ks (float):
            saturated hydraulic conductivity (in/hr or mm/hr).
        Kslp (float):
            slope of the logarithm of hydraulic conductivity versus moisture deficit (i.e., porosity minus moisture
            content) curve (in/hr or mm/hr).
        Tslp (float):
            slope of soil tension versus moisture content curve (inches or mm).
        ETu (float):
            fraction of total evaporation available for evapotranspiration in the upper unsaturated zone.
        ETs (float):
            maximum depth into the lower saturated zone over which evapotranspiration can occur (ft or m).
        Seep (float):
            seepage rate from saturated zone to deep groundwater when water table is at ground surface (in/hr or mm/hr).
        Ebot (float):
            elevation of the bottom of the aquifer (ft or m).
        Egw (float):
            groundwater table elevation at start of simulation (ft or m).
        Umc (float):
            unsaturated zone moisture content at start of simulation (volumetric fraction).
        Epat (float):
            name of optional monthly time pattern used to adjust the upper zone evaporation fraction for different
            months of the year.

    Remarks:
        Local values for ``Ebot``, ``Egw``, and ``Umc`` can be assigned to specific subcatchments in
        the [``GROUNDWATER``] section described below.
