    Section: [**XSECTIONS**]

    Purpose:
        Provides cross-section geometric data for conduit and regulator links of the drainage system.

    Formats:
        ::

            Link Shape      Geom1 Geom2 Geom3 Geom4 (Barrels Culvert)
            Link CUSTOM     Geom1 Curve (Barrels)
            Link IRREGULAR  Tsect

    Format-PCSWMM:
        ``Link Shape Geom1 Geom2 Geom3 Geom4 (Barrels Culvert)``

    Remarks:
        The Culvert code number is used only for conduits that act as culverts
        and should be analyzed for inlet control conditions using the FHWA HDS-5 method.

        The ``CUSTOM`` shape is a closed conduit whose width versus height is described by a user-supplied Shape Curve.

        An ``IRREGULAR`` cross-section is used to model an open channel whose geometry is described by a Transect object.

    Attributes:
        Link (str): name of the conduit, orifice, or weir.
        Shape (str): cross-section shape (see Tables D-1 below or 3-1 for available shapes).
        Geom1 (float): full height of the cross-section (ft or m).
        Geom2-4: auxiliary parameters (width, side slopes, etc.) as listed in Table D-1.
        Barrels (int): number of barrels (i.e., number of parallel pipes of equal size, slope, and roughness) associated with a conduit (default is 1).
        Culvert (int): code number from Table A.10 for the conduitâ€™s inlet geometry if it is a culvert subject to possible inlet flow control (leave blank otherwise).
        Curve (str): name of a Shape Curve in the [``CURVES``] section that defines how width varies with depth.
        Tsect (str): name of an entry in the [``TRANSECTS``] section that describes the crosssection geometry of an irregular channel.

    Remarks:
        Minor losses are only computed for the Dynamic Wave flow routing option (see

        at the entrance of the conduit, exit losses on the exit velocity, and average losses on
        the average velocity.

        losses.
