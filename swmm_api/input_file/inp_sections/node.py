        Purpose:
            Identifies each junction node of the drainage system.
            Junctions are points in space where channels and pipes connect together.
            For sewer systems they can be either connection fittings or manholes.

            Elev:
                elevation of junction invert (ft or m).
            Ymax:
                depth from ground to invert elevation (ft or m) (default is 0).
            Y0:
                water depth at start of simulation (ft or m) (default is 0).
            Ysur:
                maximum additional head above ground elevation that manhole junction
                can sustain under surcharge conditions (ft or m) (default is 0).
            Apond:
                area subjected to surface ponding once water depth exceeds Ymax (ft2 or m2) (default is 0).

            If Ymax is 0 then SWMM sets the maximum depth equal to the distance
            from the invert to the top of the highest connecting link.

            If the junction is part of a force main section of the system then set Ysur
            to the maximum pressure that the system can sustain.

            Surface ponding can only occur when Apond is non-zero and the ALLOW_PONDING analysis option is turned on.

    Remarks:
        A1, A2, and A0 are used in the following expression that relates surface area (ft2 or m2) to water depth
        (ft or m) for a storage unit with FUNCTIONAL geometry:

        ùê¥rea = ùê¥0 + ùê¥1 * Depth ^ A2

        For TABULAR geometry, the surface area curve will be extrapolated outwards to meet the unit's maximum depth
        if need be.

        The parameters Psi, Ksat, and IMD need only be supplied if seepage loss through the soil at the bottom and
        sloped sides of the storage unit should be considered.
        They are the same Green-Ampt infiltration parameters described in the [INFILTRATION] section.
        If Ksat is zero then no seepage occurs while if IMD is zero then seepage occurs at a constant rate equal to
        Ksat.
        Otherwise seepage rate will vary with storage depth.
