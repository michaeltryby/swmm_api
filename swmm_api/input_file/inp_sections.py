    Section:
        [STORAGE]

    Purpose:
        Identifies each storage node of the drainage system.
        Storage nodes can have any shape as specified by a surface area versus water depth relation.

        Name Elev. MaxDepth InitDepth Shape Curve-Name/Params N/A Fevap Psi Ksat IMD

    Remarks:
        A1, A2, and A0 are used in the following expression that relates surface area (ft2 or m2) to water depth
        (ft or m) for a storage unit with FUNCTIONAL geometry:

        ùê¥rea = ùê¥0 + ùê¥1 * Depth ^ A2

        For TABULAR geometry, the surface area curve will be extrapolated outwards to meet the unit's maximum depth
        if need be.

        The parameters Psi, Ksat, and IMD need only be supplied if seepage loss through the soil at the bottom and
        sloped sides of the storage unit should be considered.
        They are the same Green-Ampt infiltration parameters described in the [INFILTRATION] section.
        If Ksat is zero then no seepage occurs while if IMD is zero then seepage occurs at a constant rate equal to Ksat.
        Otherwise seepage rate will vary with storage depth.

            station position which ends the left overbank portion of the channel (ft or m).
        Xright :
            station position which begins the right overbank portion of the channel (ft or m).
        Lfactor:
            meander modifier that represents the ratio of the length of a meandering main channel to the length of the
            overbank area that surrounds it (use 0 if not applicable).
        Wfactor:
            factor by which distances between stations should be multiplied to increase (or decrease)
            the width of the channel (enter 0 if not applicable).
        Eoffset:
            amount added (or subtracted) from the elevation of each station (ft or m).
        Elev:
            elevation of the channel bottom at a cross-section station relative to some fixed reference (ft or m).
        Station:
            distance of a cross-section station from some fixed reference (ft or m).

    Transect geometry is described as shown below, assuming that one is looking in a downstream direction:

    The first line in this section must always be a NC line. After that, the NC line is only needed when a transect has
    different Manning‚Äôs n values than the previous one.

    The Manning‚Äôs n values on the NC line will supersede any roughness value entered for the conduit which uses the
    irregular cross-section.

    There should be one X1 line for each transect.
    Any number of GR lines may follow, and each GR line can have any number of Elevation-Station data pairs.
    (In HEC-2 the GR line is limited to 5 stations.)

    The station that defines the left overbank boundary on the X1 line must correspond to one of the station entries
    on the GR lines that follow. The same holds true for the right overbank boundary. If there is no match, a warning
    will be issued and the program will assume that no overbank area exists.

    The meander modifier is applied to all conduits that use this particular transect for their cross section.
    It assumes that the length supplied for these conduits is that of the longer main channel.
    SWMM will use the shorter overbank length in its calculations while increasing the main channel roughness to account
    for its longer length.
