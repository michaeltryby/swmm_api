Detention Pond Model
====================
This example illustrates the design and analysis of a detention pond
used to limit post-development peak runoff rates to their pre-
development levels. The post-development catchment area is the same
29 acre site used in the Site Drainage Model example, with the
addition of a storage node placed at the outlet of the catchment.
This storage unit and its associated outlet structure are designed
to control the peak runoff rates from the 2-yr, 10-yr, and 100-yr
design storms.

The example also includes a representation of the pre-development
catchment area (shown in scaled-down size on the Study Area Map)
so that its runoff hydrographs for the three design storms can be
compared to those of the detention pond's outflow.

The pond has a pyramidal shape with a length to width ratio of 2 and
side wall slope of 2. It is sized so that its volume is close to the
post- minus pre-development runoff volume for the 100-yr storm leaving
some amount of freeboard height available. The pond's outlet control
structure consists of a side orifice placed at pond's invert elevation
to control outflow for the smaller storm events and a weir placed some
distance above the pond's invert to limit outflow for the larger events.
These both discharge into a circular culvert that conveys outflow to
the drainage system's outfall.

Analyze each of the three design storms, in each case plotting the
time series of runoff from the pre-development subcatchment and the
total inflow to the post-development site's outfall node on the same
graph. Check to see that the pond meets its design goal.
