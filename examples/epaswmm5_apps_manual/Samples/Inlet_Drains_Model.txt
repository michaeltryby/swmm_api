Inlet & Street Drainage Model
=============================

This example illustrates how to model street inlets with SWMM. The
same 39 acre study area used in the sample Site Drainage Model will
be analyzed. Instead of using only surface swales and culverts to
convey runoff off of the site, a series of streets and below ground
sewers has been added. There are five street conduits that run through
subcatchments S1, S2, and S7. Four of these contain inlet drains that
divert captured street runoff flow into a system of below ground
sewer pipes (P1 to P8).

To gain a better undertanding of how the model is setup:
1. Select the Streets category from the Project Browser and view the
   properties of the two types of street cross-sections made available
   to the model.
2. Open the Property Editor for Street1 and by selecting to edit its
   Shape property you can see which Street cross-section design was
   assigned to it. Do the same for Street5 and note that it was
   assigned a different type of Street cross-section.
3. Now see what inlet designs have been defined for the project by
   selecting the Inlets category from the Project Browser. There is
   just one design avaliable whose properties can be viewed by
   selecting to edit it.
4. Next see how inlets have been assigned to streets by using Street3
   as an example. Bring it into the Property Editor, select the Inlets
   property and click the ellipsis button. An Inlet Usage Editor will
   appear where you can see that the ComboInlet inlet design has been
   assigned to it whose captured flow is sent to node J2a. (If the
   Display Link Symbols map option is in effect an inlet symbol will
   appear on the street conduit as will a dotted line between the
   conduit's downstream node and the inlet's capture node).

Run the model for the 2-year design storm event and view the Street
Flow table in the Summary Report. Note that the maximum spread of
runoff across the site's streets ranges from 5 to 10 feet. If the
allowable spread to maintain traffic safety was the width of one
lane (which is 10 feet for the streets in this project) then this
arrangement of inlets would be acceptable.
